# 🚀 Machine Learning Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a collection of my **Machine Learning and Data Science projects**.  
Each project is organized into its own folder, containing Jupyter notebooks, datasets (or sample data), and documentation.  
The goal is to showcase hands-on implementations of **EDA, feature engineering, hypothesis testing, model building, and evaluation**.
