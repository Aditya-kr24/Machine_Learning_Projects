# PaisaBazaar EDA & ML Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applies Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict customer credit scores.  

## 📊 Key Steps
- Data Preprocessing (missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (univariate, bivariate, multivariate visualizations)  
- Hypothesis Testing  
- Feature Engineering & Selection  
- Machine Learning Model Comparison  

## 🏆 Results
- Random Forest achieved ~70% accuracy with balanced precision and recall.  
- Key predictors: `Outstanding_Debt`, `Credit_Utilization_Ratio`, `Annual_Income`.
